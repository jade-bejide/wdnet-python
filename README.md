Python implementation for assortativity measures for weighted and directed networks based on [1].

Each edge weight $$w_{i j}$$ is directed from node $$j$$ to node $$i$$.

This code was produced as part of my undergraduate thesis to measure network-level and community-level (using Louvain Community Detection [2]) assortativity of a social network graph.
